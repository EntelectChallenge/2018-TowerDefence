Pascal is such a beautiful language and I can only assume that most developers 
has started their careers using some flavour of Pascal, whether it was the now 
very outdated Delphi 7 or FreePascal.  That thought inspired me to create this 
Pascal StarterBot in the hope to inspire enthusiasts to keep the legacy of 
Pascal alive.

For now the StarterBot only compiles with Delphi XE, but I will add support 
for FreePascal before the end of May 2018.

Compiling the project is simple. Just open the Source\StarterBO_xxx.dpr in you 
IDE and compile.
